# Jars Rewrite

A utility for replaying jars master logs with modifications.

## Config

Define as many configs as you like, each being a .php file in the `configs` folder.

Run the config (task) with `php rewrite.php CONFIG_NAME`, e.g., `php rewrite.php myportal`

### Options

...

## Rewrite closure

You may provide a closure to rewrite the master log as it is replayed.

```
// configs/myconfig.php
return [
    ...,
    'rewrite' => function (object $line, ?object $parent, array &$add): ?bool { ... },
]
```

**`$line`** - the line from the master log, to be rewritten
**`$parent`** - if the line was nested inside another line, this is set to that other line for reference
**`$add`** - an empty array to which you may add new lines, these are then injected into the master log after $line

If you return `false` from your rewrite closure, the line is removed from the master log. If you return true or null (or don't have a return statement), the line is kept.
